# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices in Bangalore, India. The project utilizes several regression techniques to build and evaluate models for accurate price prediction.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the structure and features of the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Model Building**: Implement various regression models including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as R-squared.
5. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model using `pickle` for future use.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- pickle

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
